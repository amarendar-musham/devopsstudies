===================================Migrate Workloads to OCI===================================================

Migration = Customer's Data Center  ----->  OCI Compute

Comparatively oracle-cloud-migration is effective migration than OCVS(software-defined datacenter) migration.

Oracle Cloud Migrations(OCM) - Centralized Service for Migrations

	Phases(OCM) ==> 
		summary = Discover external VMS -> Group/Organize VMs --> Project Cost --> Replicate VM data --> Launch as OCI compute

	1. Connect & Discover	-> external assets(VMs) on VMware-vSphere
	2. Build Inventory 	-> Annotate and group assets (selecting which VMs are to be migrated into the OCI target)
	3. Assess and Plan 	-> metrics/compatiblity-assessment/shape-size/cost-estimates
	4. Replicate			-> VMDK snapshot->OSS->BlockVolume
	5. Launch				-> ResourceManager(terraform-stacks)-> OCI compute

Assets types => External asset, Inventory asset --|-- Migration asset, Target asset

-----------------------OCM process-----------------
	summary = External Env-> Agent registration -> 	VDDK(Virtual Disk Development Kit) -> Inventory(in OCI) -> group/organize -> MigrationProject -> Replication
---
1. External Environment(DataCenter): 
	(Remote Agent appliance = OracleCloudBridge/OCB) discovers VMs in source
		- download from OCM service and install it on external environment, to make resources discoverable.
	 	- OCB(plugins: discovery/replication/health-monitoring)
---
2. OCM Service:
Remote connections -> Agent+dependency, Discover+Inverntory for assets
	Source-environment	
		Agent registration in OCM -> Remote-ConnectionS-Agent - give IP of computeVM w/ above agent installation
		Agent dependency(VDDK) - select file from OSS. used for replication plugin
		
	Discovery/Asset-source creation
		-> select vCenter-endpoint/creds-from-vaultSecret
		-> select Source-environment
		
	Run Discovery.... from asset-source page.
	Inventory -> check the dicovered details in the inventory page.

3. Migration Project -> Assets(Inventory + Replication), Plans(strategy)
	Migration Assets
	• Add assets (Inventory > Migration)
	• Choose replication schedule, replication location
	Migration Plans
	• Select strategy=CPU/Memory(Asis, Peak, Avg, %), select VCN/subnet
	• Target asset - recommended shape, Asset compatibility, cost estimate

4. Replicate & Launch ## 
	Migration-project: Replicate
	 - replication-plugin of OCB, replicates snapshot(full/incremental) from customerEnvironment to OCI(OSSbucket)
	 - hydration Agent = Transfer data from OSS replication bucket -> BV (a temp ComputeVM, automatically provisioning/terminate)
	migration-plan-> Generate/Deploy RMS stack(ResourceManager) 

	Launch target instance(get ip from created resources in the project)

---------------------------------------
Database Migration 
	=> Env change(On-prem to cloud) / DB-Character-set(UTF-8) change / Architecture change(non-container to multi-tenant) / DB Type (non-oracle to Oracle)

Business Goals
	Infrastructure Modernization - retire legacy systems, gain competitive edge.
	Agile Platform - Rapid development,
	Performance Improvement - Boost application response time.
	Consolidation - Optimize resource utilization and cost.
	Downtime - Least impact on business
	TCO Reduction - Cost savings over CAPEX and OPEX
	Choice of Target DB - Supports required and advanced features

Factors Influencing Database Migration (Technical factors)
	DB type (Oracle, MS SQL), DB version, Data types compatibility, Size(source DB)
	Conversion of routines to their equivalents in target DB 
	Network bandwidth b/w environments for data transfer
	Possible fallback option to avoid business disruption
	Additionally --> DB Character set, Data encryption, Data loss protection for source DB

Avoiding DB Migration Pitfalls ==> Cost overrun, DB migration failure (Poor migration strategy)

Oracle DB Migration to OCI Benefits = Simpler Management, Reliability, Scalability, Security, Automation, Integrated Platform

-------------------------Migration Modes--------------------------
::
	Offline Migration - source application=offline/frozen(no-access) # more downtime
	Online Migration - source app+DB accessible during migration, Target DB will be in syn at end of migration ## zero/near-zero downtime


Migration Types:
	Physical Migration 
		- Block-wise copy is made of physical DB files. 
		- DB version must be same in src & dest. 
		- filteration of sourceDB objects not possible
	Logical Migration 
		- Copy of database logical objects and data is created in compatible target database. 
		- DB version can be different. - filteration possible. 

Migration Advisors: https://apexadb.oracle.com/ords/r/dbexpert/dbsn/home

	Service Advisor (OCI DB)
		Which database service should I choose? Decide based on - 
			Service Type, Deployment Type, Workload Types, Management Model, Data Sensitivity, Security Needs, Availability

	Methods Advisor (OCM)
		Which migration method would be best for this scenario? based on - 
			Migration Mode (Online / Offline), Migration Type (Physical / Logical)	

	Cloud Premigration Advisor Tool (CPAT)
		Determines suitability, analyzes source DB metadata compatibility w/ target DB(OCI)
		Integrated w/ DB migration tools. 

		How does this work? 
			- Download & Setup Java-binary for Windows/Linux and connect to DB to perform check DB-objects + conditions
			- Generates Reports(results and actions required if any), remediation scripts 

	Cloud Migration Advisor Tool (used by Oracle only)
		Workflow? Collect(estate info) -> Load(extract) -> More Details(downtime,host + n/w) -> Customize(migration scenario) -> Solution
		Extractors = CPAT, CSV Exporter, Excel, OEM collector

	Oracle Estate Explorer Tool(OEE) - Helps optimize oracle database migration plan
		Analyze results w/ visualization(APEX)

------------------------------Migration Methods---------------------

Recovery Manager (RMAN) Oracle Database's Backup and Recovery Client-----
	Backup -> Restore and Recover -> Automate and Administer Backup Strategy

	Is a physical migration method
	Copies used blocks in database files to backup sets
	Takes full and incremental backups with security enabled


	Prerequisites to Migrate Oracle Database Using RMAN
		- Character set compatibility b/w source & target DB(OCI)
		- Source DB should be in archive log mode.
		- Platform migration support
		- Freeze source DB changes for complete migration. (READ ONLY mode)
		- Faster network bandwidth between source and OCI availability domain

	RMAN Migration Options (target OCI platform = little endian = significant byte at the end)
		RMAN Cross-Platform Data Transport Using Backup Sets(DB,files,tablespaces)	#Source platform can be little/big endian
		RMAN Convert Transportable Tablespace with Data Pump 						#Source platform can be little/big endian

		RMAN Transportable Tablespace with Data Pump ## w/o conversion	#Source platform must be little endian (OCI DB platform)
		RMAN Cross-Platform Transportable PDB							#Source platform must be little endian (OCI DB platform)
		RMAN Duplicate from Active Database's							#Source platform must be little endian (OCI DB platform)

Data Pump Migration Utility---- (offline=READ ONLY), (Supports OCI Base DB, Exadata DB, and ADB service as target)

	- (offline=READ ONLY) = source DB tablespace must be Freezed for changes = READ ONLY mode
	Logical migration method
	No dependency on endianness
	Character set independent
	Control over migration of database objects
	Requires more downtime for migration (slower)

	Options
		Data Pump Transportable tablespace			#Source DB platform must be little endian (OCI DB platform)		
			- Compatible Character Set = src DB charset same/subset of target DB(OCI)
			- Faster (copy DB files & metadata export of tablespaces)
			- supports Base DB, Exadata, Public Cloud, C@C(Cloud @Customer DataCenter)

		Data Pump - Full Transportable (entire DB migration method)
			- Compatible Character Set = src DB charset same/subset of target DB(OCI)
			- Full Transportable Is a 12c Feature

Remote Cloning --------(offline=READ ONLY), (Migrate to Base DB & Exadata DB in public cloud & C@C)
	Source DB platform must be little endian (OCI DB platform)	
	
	- Clones Source to target DB using a Database Link

	Source database can be PDB(pluggable) or non-CDB(non-container) (12.1.0.2 and later)
	Source DB character sets and national character sets must be compatible with target DB in OCI
	.
	Note: cloning remote non-CDB to OCI DB: execute noncdb_to_pdb.sql in target PDB before opening it.


Unplug and Plug -------- (Migrate to Base DB & Exadata DB in public cloud & C@C)
	Source DB platform must be little endian.

	- unplugs source pDB and plugs in to 12c CDB in OCI

	Source database can be PDB or non-CDB (12.1.0.2 and later).
	Source DB character sets and national character sets must be compatible with target DB in OCI.


	PDB --> OCI DB service
		close & unplug, generate [XML metadata file, data files], transfer them to target OCI DB service compute, create PDB using these files. 

	non-CDB --> OCI DB service
		READ ONLY, generate [metadata, data files], transfer to target compute, create PDB using files, execute noncdb_to_pdb.sql


UI Based Oracle DB Migration Tools ---------- provides Guided workflow to perform oracle DB migration
	1. Enterprise Manager Migration Workbench (enterprise only = no standard version of it) (minimal downtime)
		Plan (identify DBs) -> Migrate (DataPump / RMAN Transportable Tablespace) -> Analyze (Monitor migration tasks, cleanup migration files post migration)

	2. Oracle SQL Developer (migration wizard) - Selectively Migrate schema, data and database objects. 
		Use Data Pump, SQL*Loader, Insert Statements
			- Online Capture
			- Offline Capture (.bat,,sql, .ocp)

Oracle Data Guard --------- a DisasterRecovery feature [replication primary <-> standby], but can be used as a migration method (failover/switchover capabiility)

	Supported Source = Endian: Little, Platform: {Linux, Windows}, Arch : x86-64

	Physical Online Migration Method, Meet zero or near zero-downtime requirement

Oracle Golden Gate --------- Real Time data replication solution, Built on microservices architecture
	Replication => On-premises -dataPump-export-> OSS -dataPump-import->OCI

	- Leverage for logical online migration, Meet zero or near-zero migration requirement

Zero-Downtime Migration(ZDM) Method ------------ End-to-End oracle DB migration automation tool (zero to minimal downtime <15min)
	
	How it works? 
		ZDM Host = download ZDM binary and configure
		Migration Orchestration = configure source + target connection (ssh,sudo, ports, dump destination, CPAT, dry-run)
		Customize Migration Workflow using response file custom plug-ins with user actions


OCI Database Migration Service ------ Fully-managed oracle database migration service in OCI
	- Compliant with Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)
	- Driven by ZDM(Zero-Downtime Migration) Engine
	- Configure workflow and control migration job, directly from OCI Console - pause, resume, rerun, terminate, pre-check etc
	- Integrated with other OCI services


	Supports: online/offline oracle DB migration in OCI DB services, Migrate Oracle DB from 11.2.0.4 release and above (Std/Ent Edn.)
		- Source Oracle DB Platform - Linux, Oracle Solaris, AIX
		- Source DB Environments - On-premises, OCI, and non-oracle cloud (3rdparty=AWS/Azure)
		- Target DB - OCI DB services in public cloud (Base, Exa, ADB)
	flow:
		sourceDB -dataPump-export-> OSS -dataPump-import-> OCI # DB link for export + import
		Note: +Golden Gate for online migration

------------------DATA transfer-------------------------
Types of DATA Transfers ## encryption:AES256, NIST standard to erase data after copy.
	1. Disk-Based Data Transfer 			## customer-supplied storage devide
	2. i) Appliance-Based Data Transfer 	## Oracle-supplied transfer appliance
	   ii) Appliance-Based Data Export 		## oracle-supplied.... <= 34TB

Disk-Based data transfer: 
	process:
	Customer-provided commercial hard disk drive, purchase disk
	Send your data as files on encrypted USB 2.0/3.0 disk to an Oracle transfer site
	Operators at the Oracle transfe site upload the files into your designated OSS bucket in your tenancy.
	The disk is shipped back to you after the data is successfully uploaded.

	data import concepts:
	import-disk, transfer-disk(logical), transfer-package, transfer-job
	Data-transfer-utility: command-line-software to prepare transfer disk
	Bucket: OSS to upload data
	Data-Host: a linux machine stores the data, you intend to copy to disk.
	Data-transfer upload user: temporary IAM user, permissions to upload data from disk to bucket

Appliance-Based Data Transfer: 
	process:
	Secure, high-capacity, Oracle-supplied storage appliances & software
	Migrate petabyte-scale datasets to OCI.
	Operators at the Oracle transfer site upload the files into your designated OSS bucket in your tenancy.

	data import concepts:
	Data Transfer Appliance
	Terminal Emulation Host - to communicate w/ import appliance
	Control Host - to perform data-transfer service tasks
	Transfer Job - logical representation of data migration to oci

	how data transfer works:
	Create a Transfer job (Console or CLI).
	Request one or more appliances.
	Connect appliance to the network, via serial console and assign IP.
	Retrieve encryption key using the data transfer utility/CLI.
	Prepare the appliance, Create Datasets (mount point).
	'Seal' data set to generate manifest filee. 'Finalize' the Transfer Appliance.
	Ship the Transfer Appliance back to Oracle.
