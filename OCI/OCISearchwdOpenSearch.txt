-------------------------------------OCI Search with OpenSearch-------------------------------------

Basic Search:		Entering keywords into a Search engine to find relevant information
		
		=> Crawling(web pages) -> Indexing -> Ranking (Retrieval) -> Delivery (highly indexed results)

OpenSearch:			open-source search and analytics suite that includes: [ OpenSearch Engine + Dashboards] originated from ElasticSearch

OpenSearch supports: Text, images, logs, metrics, Sentiment analysis, structured/unstructured data

Itâ€™s useful for:
	Log analytics
	Real-time application monitoring
	Website and enterprise search

It uses a Query DSL (Domain Specific Language), a flexible JSON-based syntax to define complex queries.


OCI Search with OpenSearch Key aspects:
	Fully managed(deployment, provisioning, patching, scaling, backup, and security)
	Secure
	Generative AI
	Automated HA
	Powerful Insight

Open Search Core Concepts:::::

	Cluster:	A group of nodes running OpenSearch(1 primary node) = nodes X-ADs
		Data Node: Stores and processes data, performs indexing and search operations
		Leader Node: Manages cluster operations, node coordination, and metadata
		Dashboard Node: Hosts and serves OpenSearch Dashboards

	Index:	A data structure that speeds up search operations
		Index storage: Structured data references
		Index population: Feeding search data into OpenSearch
		Reduced resource usage: Lower CPU and memory through indexing

	Dashboard
		Visualization tool for real-time analytics
		User interface for interacting with OpenSearch data and plugins

	Private Endpoints
		Provide secure, VCN-internal access to OpenSearch clusters and dashboards
		Ensure traffic stays within the OCI network


Prerequisites for OCI Search Cluster Setup:
	OCI Account, Compartments, VCN/Subnet, IAM policies


Creating OCI IAM Resources: Create an Identity-Domain(w/ a Administrator), Group, Users

	Allow group search-opensearch-admins to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy
	Allow group search-opensearch-admins to manage opensearch-family in tenancy

Cluster creation: 
		name, compartment, openSearch version, security(administrator), 
		#nodes(data,leader,dashboard)(ocpu,memory,storage), node-profile(development, applicationSearch, logAnalytics)
		VCN, subnet
