OCI-Azure Interconnect Introduction====================================
  building blocks component comparision b/w OCI & AZURE.
		Component		OCI 				Azure
		Virtual Network		VCN 				VNet
		Virtual Circuit		FastConnect Virtual Circuit 	ExpressRoute Circuit
		Gateway			Dynamic Routing Gateway(DRG)	Virtual Network Gateway(VNG)
		Routing			Route Tables			Route Tables
		Security/Firewall	Security Lists			Network Security Groups
					Network Security Groups

Azure end:
	create resourceGroup, VirtualNetwork+subnet+VM+VNG(type=Express-routing)
	create ExpressRoute-circuit(provider=Oracle Cloud FastConnect)
OCI end:
	create compartment, VCN+subnet+DRG. routeTable for VCN -> target:DRG|dest:AzureVNetCIDR
	create virtual-circuit/FastConnect(Partner=Microsoft Azure:ExpressRoute)
		- private virtual circuit, DRG(VCNs), BGP IPaddr

Azure: create connection - select (type:ExpressRoute), VNG, ExpressRoute-circuit
==> you will be able to ping VM across OCI and Azure with private ips of each others.

Oracle Database@Azure====================================
	OCI Pod in Azure DataCenter = extention of OCI region => AD2.1 + AD3.1
	ExaVNIC <--link--> ExaPrivateIP

	Operational Interface:
		Microsoft Azure (infra + vm-cluster)
		- Provision Exadata Infrastructure and Exadata VM cluster using Azure portal, Azure APls, SDKs and Terraform.
		- Manage the provisioned Oracle Exadata Database Service resources (scale Servers, OCPUs, maintenance)
 		- Monitor infrastructure and database metrics, events and logs

	 	ORACLE CLOUD Infrastructure (database)
		- Provision Database Homes. Provision Container and pluggable databases
		- Manage the databases (Data Guard, Automatic Backup configuration, updates to Gl, System, Databases)
		- Migrate to the provisioned databases in Exadata database Service

	Provision Exadata Infrastructure: user must be of admin-group(Oracle Database@Azure Infra)
	• Azure Subscription and Resource Group name ## resourceGroup=comparment in OCI
	• Instance Name, Region, AZ, OCI account name
	• Infrastructure model name (ex: X9M-2)
	• Number of Database Servers(limit: 2-32), Storage Servers(limit: 3-64) => OCPUs/Storage
	• Maintenance method(rolling/non-rolling) and Select Schedule

	Provision Oracle Exadata VM Cluster: user must be of admin-group(Oracle Database@Azure VM cluster) ## Azure Vnet with 2subnets(deligated)
	• Azure Subscription and Resource Group name
	• Name, Region, Cluster Name, above created Exa-infra, License Type
	• Grid Infrastructure version, SSH public Key, TZ
	• VM Cluster configuration (Compute count, shape, OCPU/VM,memory/VM,local storage/VM, Exadata Storage)
	• Optionally, enable sparse snapshots, local backups and distribution
	• Provide delegated subnets for client and backup

	Provision Oracle Exadata Database(CDB & PDB): user must be of admin-group(Oracle Database@Azure CDB or PDB) 
	- Click on "OCI Database URL:Go To OCI" in Exadata VM Cluster Overview page(azure)
	- In OCl Console, provision database home and databases (CDB and PDB) - select user(sys)+password ## {container|pluggable} databases
-----------------------
Oracle Cloud VMware Solution(OCVS)====================================provider: VMware by Brodcom
	
	Software-Defined Data Center(SDDC) - Logical Abstraction: Virtual Data Centers as a Service

	Note: a customer can use this service to migrate his own datacenter to OCI w/o an overhead. Just get the VMs into software-defined-data-center(OCVS)

	SDDC components in deployments:
		vSpere - Hypervisor on BM Compute instance(combination of ESXi and vCenter)
		vSAN - Software Defined Storage
		NSX-T - Software-Defined Networking and Security

	OCVS - Design Hybird Cloud:
	- FastConnect: A dedicated network link providing a higher quality of service compared to the internet, achieving lower-latency, higher-bandwidth links (1 Gbps or 10 Gbps)
	- VMware HCX (Hybrid Cloud Extension): A set of virtual appliances that provides secure connectivity between environments supporting migration and DR operations

	HCX Components:
		- HCX Manager - Target for SitePairing
			• One HCX manager per SDDC
			• Licensed with SDDC deployment
			• Service Mesh are tunnel receivers

		- HCX Connector - Source(On-Prem) for SiteParing;
			• Cannot pair with another connector
			• Licensed based on SDDC deployment
			• Service Mesh are tunnel
	Service Mesh
		HCX IX - Interconnect
		HCX WO - WAN Optimization
		HCX NE - Network Extension
