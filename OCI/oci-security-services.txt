OCI Bastion service
		 provides secure & time-limited access to oci-resources, w/o public-ip. Can be deployed in private subnet & security zones
		 creates SSH tunnel to target oci-resource 
		 security: IAM-authz(who can create/update/edit bastion), time-limited, no-public-ip, added security w/ cidr-block-allowlist.
	Session Types
		Managed SSH session =>
							ssh -o ProxyCommand="<>" -p 22 opc@<target-pvtIP> -i <TargetHostPrivateKey> ]
							ProxyCommand = ssh -W %h:%p -p 22 <ocid1.bastionsession..>  -i BastionSessonPrivateKey
						
		SSH port forwarding session => for RDP/3389 or DB/1521
							ssh -i <BastionSessionPrivateKey> -N -L <LocalPort>:10.0.1.21:3389 -p 22 <ocid1.bastionsession..> #you can consule local system's pvt-key


		Dynamic port forwarding session => you will get access to all the ports...

	limitations: 5 bastions/region, 20 sessions/bastion, max-session: 180 mins, 
			Association: Single VCN only
			Dependency: Oracle agent must be running(bastion-plugin)

Network firewall 		## FOR ALL TCP/UDP/ICMP
		Barrier b/w internet and web application servers (IGW --> firewall --> Application(public.subnet))
		firewall from Cyber-Threats, Access-Control, Network-Segmentation, Application-Layer-Filtering, Content-Filtering
	Deployment:
		Centralized Model - Firewall in a dedicated VCN(Hub) routes traffice to application VCN(Spoke) through DRG
		Distributed Model - firewall in same VCN as application but dedicated subnet=firewall-subnet. 

	n/w firewall Policy: 
		decryption-rules - decrypt traffic from source|dest. w/ SSL-forward-proxy / SSL-inspection
	 	security-rules - allow/drop/intrusion-detection/reject traffic based on match condition formed using below components

	n/w firewall Policy Components:
		Application[lists]: layer 7, identify specific functionalities for granular security rules. = ICMP rule
		Services[lists]: layer 3/4(protocols,ports), define rules independently = TCP/UDP rules
		URL lists: grouping urls(*,^)
		Address lists: IPs or ranges for precise control. It can be either sourceIPs or destinationIPs

	Example setup: flow = Internet -> IGW <--> NFW <--> VCN

	1. add security rule by selecting the above components for below items either to block or allow traffic. # ex: control access to websites.
			source			destination	App/URL			Action
			any 			vm1			SSH				allow
			vm1				any 		facebook.com 	deny
			10.0.0.0/16		any 		any 			allow 	## allow all at the end to avoid blocking traffic by default from n/w firewall.

	2. create n/w firewall in the particular VCN/subnet. 
	3. Add route-table rules and associate:						
			IG attachment:	source:internet, dest:VCN,	target:NFW-ip ## inbound-traffic
			NFW attachment: souce:nfw,	dest:0.0.0.0/0,	target:IGW ## allow access to internet attach this to NFW
			VCN attachment:	source:VM,	dest:0.0.0.0/0,	target:NFW-ip(pvt) ## outbound-traffic

WAF(web application firewall) - uses OWASP security ruleset ## ONLY FOR 80/443 PORTS as we attach WAF w/ LoadBalancer
	prevent attacks exploiting a web-application like SQL-injection, XSS(cross-site-scripting), DDoS attack

	WAF Service Components
		WAF Policy - Encompasses the overall configuration of your WAF service on OCI
		Origin(ex: LB-ip) - Your web application's host server and must be defined in WAF policy in order to set up protection rules, etc. 
		Protection Rules - Can be configured to allow or block or log network requests based on specified criteria, i.e., OWASP Rules
		Bot Management - Allows detecting bot traffic to your web applications and either allow or block the traffic
		Access control - access-rules(URL/IP), IPaddr-whitelisting ## allow/block traffic

OCI Certificates(FREE) - private Certificate Authority manager
	creates and manages TLScerts/CAs/CAbundles ## CA=certificateAuthrorities
	integration w/ LB and API Gateway
	can import 3rdparty CA to use in an OCI teanancy

	Certificates - Digital document that confirms its subject is the owner of the public key
	Certificate Authorities (CA) - Issues certificates and subordinate CAs, 
	CA Bundles - Includes root and intermediate certificates, certificate properties, user-provided contextual metadata
	Certificate Chains - List of certificates from the end-entity certificate to the root certificate
	Certificate Revocation List - Contains all CAs and certificates that the issuing CA has revoked prior to their expiration dates

	note: Private Keys only stored in KMS Service without persisting any copies in OCI Certificates data store.

	modes of operation:
		Manage internally -> full automation to customers from OCI including renewals & deployments.
		Manage externally -> If customer wants to keep private key with himself. upload signing request(CSR), then CA-in-OCI will sign certificate. 
		BYOC - Bring your own Certificate - existing cert.

	LCM features: create CAs/certificates/CAbundles, import/update/tag/delete/Renew certs, configure rules, specify-current-version/revoke-version for CA or cert

	1. create a vault, and create a MEK(master encryption key) in it. 
	2. create CA (choose above MEK), create certificate under this CA.
	3. add cert to LB.

OCI Key Management Service (KMS)
	OCI Encryption Options:
		Oracle Managed Encryption				- Fully managed by Oracle, No control over keys
		Vault Customer-managed Encryption		- Customer control keys, Virtual Vault & Private Vault, Single-tenant/ Multi-tenant HSMs
		Dedicated Customer-managed Encryption	- Customer control HSMs and keys Single-tenant HSMs
		External Customer-managed Encryption	- Customer control HSMs and keys Single-tenant HSMs outside OCI

	Features 					Virtual Vault 		Private Vault		Dedicated KMS 	External KMS
	Tenant isolation			Multitenant 		Single tenant 		Single tenant 	Single tenant
	Customer Control 			Keys 				Keys 				Keys and HSMs 	Keys and HSMs
	Supported key types 		HSM and Software 	HSM and Software	HSM 			External
	OCI Services Integration 	Yes 				Yes 				No 				Yes

	OCI Dedicated KMS:
		Full Control - Fully managed, single-tenant HSM partition providing exclusive access and control.
		High Security Standards - FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified partitions offer industry-leading security for key management. full control over Key-generation
		Industry-standard interfaces - PKCS#11 for cryptographic operations. End-to-end encryption from apps to HSM(data security without OCIAPls)
		Scalability and Availability - Default provision of three synchronized and highly available HSM partitions per OCI region.

		Workflow setting up HSM cluster:
			-> create cluster, Initialize, install/configure(client utilities), activate cluster, install PKCS#11 provider

	External KMS: 
		Native Encryption Using {OCI Vault, OCI Virtual Private Vault} > Bring Your Own Key(BYOK) > Hold Your Own Key(HYOK) > Bring Your Own Encryption (BYOE)
		<Low ------------------Customer Control------------------ High>

		Separate Management and Control: HYOKs
		External Key Integration: integrate keys from your on-premises or third-party key management solutions with OCI services.
		Centralized Key Management
		Enhanced Security: The external keys are never cached or stored in OCI.
		Control: full control over encryption keys and access policies.

		Workflow: OCI apps/services --> OCI ExternalKMS --> 3rdPartyKMS(customer-premices)
