AI, ML & DL Cheatsheet
AI vs ML vs DL

AI: Machines mimic human abilities
Examples: Self-driving cars, chatbots
ML (Subset of AI): Learn from data
Examples: Spam filters, credit scoring
DL (Subset of ML): Deep neural networks
Examples: Image recognition, ChatGPT
Types of Machine Learning

Supervised: Learn from labeled data
Examples: Fraud detection, approvals
Unsupervised: Find patterns in unlabeled data
Examples: Customer clusters, trends
Reinforcement: Learn via trial & error
Examples: Game AI, autonomous driving
