AWS S3
1. volume vs vault storage, traditional storage
2. Cloud storage, AWS Storage options(EBS[block storage], S3&Glacier[object storage])
3. AWS Connection storage [Storage gateway, snowball]
4. AWS CLI

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&&&&&&&&&&&&
volume: it's a storage device[ formatted to store directories, & files]
vault: a storage box [stores the achive data for longer period of time]

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&&&&&&&&&&&&
Cloud storage: fast service with low cost & low risk, 
			   easy migration of data, easy cloud-based backup and archiving solutions
Is a service model in which data is 
maintained, managed, backed up remotely, made available to users over a n/which / [pay per use, monthly rate]

EBS volumes & Snapshot:
	EBS provides block level storage volumes for EC2 instances.
	primary storage for data [that requires frequent updates for database application]
  *EBS Snapshot, can backup data on EBS volumes to S3
  these are incremental backups
  *snapshots of encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted\
  *volume created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted

fdisk -l // create and attach EBS to instance, then check 
fdisk /dev/xvdf // create new logical partition (n, e ; n, l)
lsblk --> /dev/xvdf1
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf1 ; mkdir /test
mount /dev/xvdf1 /test ; df -h
partprobe /dev/xvdf1  // uploading kernel
// before detaching u need to umount disk

 % should be in same availability zone. 
types of EBS Volumes: general purpose (SSD) --> developement & test env
					  provisioned IOPS (SSD) --> large database
					  magnetic --> cold storage
ssd(solid state disk) -- like RAM; IOPS[I/O operations per sec]

S3(bucket):simple storage service
	used to store objects, consists of data, metadata(describes data)
	when object added to bucket, amazon s3 generates uniq <version ID>
	default --- only 100 buckets can be created
simple interface , helps to store & retrieve any amount of data, at any time , from anywhere on the web

types of S3 Storage : standard, standard-Infrequent access, Glacier
 
 -- cross-region replication [same key(name), same metadata]
 -- versioning (keeps multiple variants of an object in same bucket)
S3 transfer acceleration->prefered to transfer small amount of data

$$$$$$$ S3 objects can be accessed  using http from anywhere [permssions req]
1. url of that object;2. AWS CLI (put/get);3. AWS SDK method to(put/get)

can create policy, [set permissions] - json formatted
storage --standard, standerd IA , Glacier


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&&&&&&&&&&&&
snowball: h/w device, end-end encryption, used to transfer lots of data b/w corporate data center to aws.

create job->connect.snowball->copyto.snowball->aws will move data to S3

Storage gateway: data centre with an virtual appliance ---> replicates the data to AWS cloud like S3 or Glacier
uses--- backup&archive, recovery, data migration replace/ expand storage

[app.server--storage.gateway.VM]--aws[storage.gateway.service--volume.storage(S3)]--[**EBS snapshot**]/[**Glacier**]

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&&&&&&&&&&&&

AWS CLI

aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id <volume-id> --description "msg"
aws configure // access-key id&secret[will generate at IAM user creation]
++ attach policy [amazon ec2 full access]
