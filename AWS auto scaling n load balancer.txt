1. Auto Scaling
2. load balancing
application <--- users
3. IAM -- identification access management
4. MFA --  multifactor authentification

need to deploy more servers, and distribute traffic

scale up
scale down

Launch configuration
	my amis, which we created from the existing servers(instances)
	rem same as ec2 instnce creation
Auto scaling group creatino
	-group name, size[start with(1)instances], 
	n/w(default vpc), subnet[select all]
	-configure scaling policy[keep intial]

measured in terms of no. of the active servers, scales automatically based on the load on the farm

after creating auto scaling group u can add load balancer in details section

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

1. classic load balancer -- equal distribute traffic [images only]
2. application load balancer -- with two LB; 1 fr blog content, 1 fr images on same website
while creating load balancer need to add instances[to be balanced]
those instances like having (apache2 service runnig)

server1[images ]
server2[blogging section ]

to control who can use the your aws resources(authentication) & what resources they can use and in what ways (authorization)

$$using IAM, you can create & manage users, and use permissions to allow & deny acces to aws resources
+user, access type(cli[programatic]+console)
+attach policy -- admistrator access

go to dashboard
*********login url for IAM users

$$groups similar to user creation

$$IAM role is an IAM entity that defines set of permissions for making AWS service requests. 
roles not associated with users/groups, can attached to EC2 instances
+role type, +policy, 

********attach in ec2-->actions[attach IAM roles]

$$policies
to assign permissions to a user, group, role, or a resource you create a policy, which is document that explicitly lists permissions
+create policy, set permissions[allow/deny]-- service, actions, ARN=*, <--generate policy

MFA
second layer of security

--> test user, security credintials -- assigned mfa device[virtual/hardware]- virtual , download app[google authenticate], scan QR and enter authenticate code
