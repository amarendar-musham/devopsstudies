kubernetes node
  kubelet
  kube-proxy
============================================

kube-apiserver: services REST operations, connects to etcd database
kube-scheduler: schedules pods on specific nodes based on labels, taints, tolerations set for pods. 
kube-controller-manager: manages current state of cluster.
etcd: key-value store that keeps the current state of cluster

---Worker Nodes

kubelet: sends request to container engine to ensure pods are available
kube-proxy: runs on everynode + uses iptables to provide an interface to connect to k8s components.
container runtime: takes care of actually running the containers. 
supervisord: monitors and guarantees the availability of kubelet and docker processes. 
network agent: implements a software defined n/w+ing solution, such as weave
logging: the CNCF project Fluentd used for unified logging in the cluster. a Fluentd agent must be installed on all k8s nodes.
