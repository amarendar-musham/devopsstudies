Automated version of EC2

it'll execute the background tasks

AWS Lambda is  a serverless compute cloud, only be used to execute background tasks

can use Lambda using AWS SDKS [s/w development kits.]

AWS SDKS with IDE[eclipse/visual studio]

--> eclipse IDE
1. help--> install available s/w -- workwith(aws.amazon.com/eclipse)
	select all tools & click finish 
2. our aim is to create an application which will upload a file  on S3, this will be processed by lambda and in-turn will send you an email all the file's details. iF You reply to that email, it shall move tha file to a special folder.

WEBSITE/email ---> S3(file system) ---> LAMBDA(background tasks)[SQS]
LAMBDA --> SES(Emailing users)[to send mails]
email ---> reply mail --> ROUTE 53 ---> SES[receive mails ]


1. Active notification---- [s3 will invoke lambda function, when a file uploaded to s3]
	S3-bucket-properties-events- + notfication
	name: aws-lambda, events:put, sendto: lambda function, function: MyFunction
2. SQS[simple queue service]
	create new queue, name: hello-lambda.fifo, quick create
	configure queue--> msg retention period 2m, save
3. SES[simple email service]
	add email address(verify new email address)
	EMAIL receiving--> Verify a new domain[free nom domain]- edureka.tk
		--> it'll give TXT && MX records, 
	
ROUTE 53--> 1.hosted zones(create )-  domain: edureka.tk  
			2.freenom- manage domains, management tools(NS)
				add NS from aws to freenom
				[changing name servers]
			3.create record sets,
				MX from SES, TXT from SES
	
	then the domain will be verified in SES

	RULE sets, create a rule, 
		recipient(hello@edureka.tk), action (+lambda)-- MyFunction2,
		rule name[lambda-demo]

4. need to give the SQS(hello-lambda.fifo) URL in lambda function as myqueueurl

5. upload the code to aws
